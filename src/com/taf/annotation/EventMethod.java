/**
 * <p>
 * The EventMethod annotation provides information on a method, telling the user
 * and the compiler (TODO) that this method is used as an event handler.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This annotation is processed by the {@link EventManager} in the
 * {@link EventManager#registerEventListener(EventListener)} method. To be
 * recognized as an event method, there are three rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The method must be public
 * <li>The method must have one argument
 * <li>The argument must be an {@link Event}
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If one of them is not met, the {@link EventManager} will discard the method.
 * The processor will display a warning if it detects an error in the event
 * method declaration (WIP). Note that if the method has a return type, it will
 * never be used.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This annotation is available during runtime, it is useful for documentation
 * and will be used to register {@link EventListener}s in the
 * {@link EventManager}.
