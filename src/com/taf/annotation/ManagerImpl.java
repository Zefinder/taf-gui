/**
 * <p>
 * The ManagerImpl annotation tells the coder that the annotated type is a
 * Manager and must be treated as is. A class implementing this annotation must
 * have no public constructor, a static method <code>getInstance</code> that
 * returns the singleton, and two public void methods <code>init()</code> and
 * <code>clear()</code>. Note that a manager must be in com.taf.manager in order
 * to be detected.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Managers are organized in priority: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH. The higher the
 * priority, the faster they need to be initialized.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This annotation is available during runtime. It is useful for documentation
 * purposes and to perform a check at launch.
