/**
 * <p>
 * The FieldType class represents the type a Field can take. Depending on the
 * the nature of the Field, different FieldTypes can be used. For example, a
 * {@link Parameter} will use types that represent coding types whereas a
 * {@link Node} will take a {@link Type} or another {@link Node} as type, stored
 * in a special node type.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class sets up basic bricks to create a FieldType. It expects the coder
 * to implement four methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #addTypeParameter(TypeParameter)} which adds a type parameter to
 * the field type.
 * <li>{@link #getMandatoryParametersName()} which returns a set of mandatory
 * parameters names, as specified in the TAF documentation.
 * <li>{@link #getOptionalParametersName()} which returns a set of optional
 * parameters names, as specified in the TAF documentation.
 * <li>{@link #typeToString()} which forces the FieldType to implement the
 * {@link #toString()} method.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Field types are created using the FieldTypeFactory (TODO) class. It requires
 * at least one constructor with no argument.
 * </p>
