/**
 * <p>
 * The EventListener represents an object that listens for events. The object
 * created with that class is registered in {@link EventManager} using the
 * object's methods annotated with {@link EventMethod}. When an event is fired,
 * the registered method linked to that event is invoked.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Classes implementing this interface must define the
 * {@link #unregisterComponents()} method. This method is used when a listener
 * is unregistered to also unregister all the listeners it could have created.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An EventListener can listen to any number of event they want, and can even
 * have multiple handler methods for the same event as long as the rules
 * specified in {@link EventMethod} are followed. Here is an example of
 * EventListener:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class ListenerTest implements EventListener {
 * 	public ListenerTest() {
 * 		EventListener.getInstance().registerEventListener(this);
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	&#64;EventMethod
 * 	public void onDummyEvent(DummyEvent event) {
 * 		System.out.println("Hello World!");
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public void unregisterComponents() {
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public void sayHi() {
 * 		EventManager.getInstance().fireEvent(new DummyEvent());
 * 	}
 * 
 * }
