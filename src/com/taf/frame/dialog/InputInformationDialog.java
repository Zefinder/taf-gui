/**
 * <p>
 * The InputInformationDialog is the base class for TAF dialogs. It contains a
 * text field and a confirm button to usually input a name.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class gives methods to add other things than just a field and a button.
 * The dialog layout is a {@link GridBagLayout} and the constraint
 * <code>c</code> is accessible as a protected field. To access the field text,
 * use {@link #getFieldNameText()}. To add a component, use
 * {@link #addComponent(JComponent, GridBagConstraints)}. It will remember the
 * position of the last <code>gridy</code> and will position the button at the
 * right place. Note that <code>c</code> is already ready for the next row, you
 * should not have to modify it.
 * </p>
